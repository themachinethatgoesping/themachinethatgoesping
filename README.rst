themachinethatgoesping
======================

| Super-project for themachinethatgoesping components (https://github.com/themachinethatgoesping)

| Hi there ðŸ‘‹ **themachinethatgosping** (short: **Ping**) aims at enabling advanced processing of multibeam and singlebeam echosounder data. Core components of this library are implemented in C++ (for performance) and are then exposed as high level python interfaces (for usability). On top of the core, many libraries, tools and applications will be implemented in Python directly, making use of the fast prototyping features of this language.
|
| This project is in early stage; at the moment it is just a powerfull raw data reader for Kongsberg .all/.wcd and Simard .raw data. However you can get glimples of what ping will be like and e.g. plot some simple echograms or extract the navigation data from the raw files (see tutorials repository)
|
| More will follow soon. If you are interested in our plans and time line, contact me: peter.urban@ugent.be

installation
============

**Ping** is distributed via pypi. Install e.g. via pip:

.. code-block:: python

  pip install themachinethatgoesping
  
Anaconda packages will follow.

To install ping from source, clone this repository and use pip:

.. code-block:: python
  
  pip install .
  
As a potential developer, you will prefer to use the `meson <https://mesonbuild.com/>`_ backend which provides a propper developer interface. (TODO: check/improve developer build instructions for windows/linux/mac) 
First clone this repository. Then install the build requirements:

.. code-block:: python
  
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
Then call meson

.. code-block:: python

  meson setup builddir
  meson build -c builddir
  meson install -c builddir
  
WARNING: these instructions are only a preview; they are not yet complete. If you have no experience with meson, contact me: peter.urbam@ugent.be

tutorials
=========

We provide jupyter notebook tutorials with instalation instructions in the tutorials repository: `tutorials <https://github.com/themachinethatgoesping/tutorials>`_
